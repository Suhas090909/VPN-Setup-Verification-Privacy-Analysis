# VPN-Setup-Verification-Privacy-Analysis
Objective:

To understand how a VPN protects privacy, encrypts traffic, and hides the user’s IP address by setting up a free VPN client, connecting to a server, verifying the connection, and analyzing VPN benefits and limitations.

1. VPN Selected

ProtonVPN – Free Plan
Reason for selection:

Offers unlimited data even on free tier

Strong AES-256 encryption

Good privacy policies (no logs)

Easy-to-use Windows client

Reliable server availability

2. Step-by-Step Setup & Connection Process
Step 1: Create Account

Visited ProtonVPN official website.

Signed up for a Free VPN account using email verification.

Step 2: Download and Install

Downloaded the ProtonVPN Windows Client.

Installed and opened the application.

Logged in using created credentials.

Step 3: Connect to a Server

Launched the ProtonVPN app.

Clicked Quick Connect, which automatically selected the fastest free server.

Status changed to Connected, showing server name and location.

3. Verification of VPN Connection
A. IP Address Check

Before connecting:

Visited whatismyipaddress.com → noted original IP & ISP.

After connecting:

Refreshed the page → IP changed to VPN server location.

This confirmed the VPN tunnel is active and the real IP is hidden.

B. Encrypted Traffic Check

Visited multiple websites (Google, YouTube).

Verified HTTPS lock icon + ProtonVPN encrypted tunnel.

Ensures data is protected from ISPs, attackers, and public Wi-Fi threats.

C. Speed Comparison

Performed a quick test using FAST.com before and after VPN use.

VPN speed was slightly slower (expected due to encryption and routing).

4. Privacy & Security Features Observed
✔ AES-256 Encryption

Protects all outgoing & incoming data.

✔ IP Masking

Your real identity & location remain hidden.

✔ Kill Switch (Enabled)

Blocks internet traffic if VPN disconnects unexpectedly.

✔ DNS Leak Protection

Prevents DNS queries from revealing your ISP details.

✔ OpenVPN / WireGuard Protocols

Industry-standard secure communication protocols.

5. Browsing Experience

Able to browse normally while connected.

Slight decrease in speed but still usable.

Websites loaded securely and without errors.

6. VPN Benefits
🟢 Advantages

Hides real IP address and location.

Encrypts all traffic, securing data on public Wi-Fi.

Stops ISP and websites from tracking browsing activity.

Helps bypass geo-restrictions.

Protects against network-level attacks like sniffing.

7. VPN Limitations
🔴 Limitations

Free VPN servers are limited (fewer locations).

Speed is lower due to encryption.

Some websites and apps block VPN IPs.

VPN cannot stop phishing or malware.

Free plans usually don’t support streaming/P2P.

8. Screenshots Collected 

Attach the following screenshots to complete the task:

IP address before VPN connection

IP address after VPN connection

ProtonVPN connected window

Browsing a website while VPN is active

Kill switch enabled 

Speed test before/after (optional)

9. Conclusion

The task demonstrated how a VPN enhances online privacy and security by encrypting data and masking the real IP address. ProtonVPN successfully changed the IP address, encrypted traffic, and maintained stable connectivity. Although free VPNs have limitations, they still provide essential protection against tracking and unsecured network threats.
